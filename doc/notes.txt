HTTPS support:
==============

Windows:
--------
  A self-signed certificate was created and registered for testing purposes
  (see cer/windows/self-signed.cer).

  Overview:
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11403333/httplistener-with-https-support

  Windows 8.1 SDK (for makecert.exe)
  sdksetup.exe - http://www.microsoft.com/click/services/Redirect2.ashx?CR_EAC=300135395

    > set path=%path%;c:\program files\windows kits\8.1\bin\x86

    Succeeded

  [As Administrator]
    > makecert -sk self-signed -iv server-auth.pvk -n "CN=self-signed" -ic server-auth.cer self-signed.cer -sr localmachine -ss My
    Succeeded

  [As Administrator]
    > netsh http add sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:8443 certhash=df52b2cb0a33207c95118f84b8f7b4a3bc8dc9c3 appid={769F2E76-AE87-4825-8157-C82CBF769DDD}

    SSL Certificate successfully added

  To verify [as Administrator]:
    > netsh http show sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:8443

    SSL Certificate bindings:
    -------------------------

        IP:port                      : 0.0.0.0:8443
        Certificate Hash             : df52b2cb0a33207c95118f84b8f7b4a3bc8dc9c3

        Verify Client Certificate Revocation : Enabled
        Verify Revocation Using Cached Client Certificate Only : Disabled

        DS Mapper Usage              : Disabled
        Negotiate Client Certificate : Disabled

  To uninstall the cert again [as Administrator]:
    > netsh http delete sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:8443

    SSL Certificate successfully deleted

  To allow use of 127.0.0.1 in addition to localhost (for testing two
  different 'domains' for http vs https), run the following commmand [as
  Administrator]:

    > netsh http add urlacl url=https://127.0.0.1:8443/ user=%USERDOMAIN%\%USERNAME% listen=yes

    URL reservation successfully added

  This will block further access to https://localhost:8443/, so you may want
  to add that back as well:

    > netsh http add urlacl url=https://localhost:8443/ user=%USERDOMAIN%\%USERNAME% listen=yes

    URL reservation successfully added

  To reset the ACLs back to original state, issue the commands with 'add'
  replaced by 'delete' and only the 'url=' parameter [as Administrator]:

    > netsh http delete urlacl url=https://127.0.0.1:8443/

    URL reservation successfully deleted

    > netsh http delete urlacl url=https://localhost:8443/

    URL reservation successfully deleted


Linux:
------
  Different certificates may be needed to test https on Linux: see
  cer/linux/self-signed.cer/.pvk.
  Note that unlike Windows, Administrator privileges are _not_ required for
  either the makecert or httpcfg commands.

    > makecert -r -n "CN=self-signed" -sv self-signed.pvk self-signed.cer
    Mono MakeCert - version 3.1.2.0
    X.509 Certificate Builder
    Copyright 2002, 2003 Motus Technologies. Copyright 2004-2008 Novell. BSD licensed.

    Success

    > httpcfg -add -port 8443 -cert self-signed.cer -pvk self-signed.pvk

  To verify the certificate is installed:
    > httpcfg -list
    Port: 8443 Thumbprint: C5A355DA2FC5571053ED9F5B2629178712D7EDC0

  To uninstall, use this:
    > httpcfg -del -port 8443

  No special action is required to respond to listen to
  https://127.0.0.1:8443/ in addition to https://localhost:8443/, but note
  that it is not possible to add _both_ as prefixes to the same server: this
  will cause an 'Address already in use' error.


Databases:
==========

  Currently only MySql is supported. Can be installed using either Chocolatey
  or apt-get (depending on platform).

Windows:
--------
    [As Administrator]
    > choco install mysql

Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):
----------------------
    > sudo apt-get install mysql-server
  Also, if necessary:
    > sudo /etc/init.d/mysql start


To set up user/db for forum software (any platform):

    >mysql -u root
    Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
    Your MySQL connection id is 68
    Server version: 5.6.24 MySQL Community Server (GPL)

    owners.

    Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

    mysql> create database forum;
    Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

    mysql> use forum;
    Database changed
    mysql> create user forum@localhost identified  by 'n0ts3cr3t';
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)

    mysql> grant all on forum.* to forum@localhost;
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)

    mysql> \q
    Bye

  You can then run something like the following to initialize database tables:

    > mysql -D forum -u forum -p***** < src\forum\dbs.mysql
    > mysql -D forum -u forum -p***** < src/forum/dbs.mysql
